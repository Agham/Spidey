# Spidey
This is an open source website crawler written in Python to crawl all the urls of a particular wbesite. 
To make use of this crawler all you need to do is just run "main.py" and enter a "project name" and "url of wbesite" in the respective order.
That's It !! Spidey will crawl the website for you. 
A file called "crawled.txt" will contain the final list of crawled urls.
